# ML Project README

## Project Overview
This repository contains two machine learning projectsm, as well as a complementary essay on nueral networks. The first project focuses on analysing a dataset related to cars, while the second project examines data on forest fires. These projects aim to demonstrate the application of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Linear Regression algorithms, respectively.

## Datasets
- **Car Dataset**: This dataset includes various attributes of cars, such as safety, doors, weight and maintenance. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is applied to predict outcomes based on the k-value.
- **Forest Fire Dataset**: This dataset includes data related to forest fires, such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Linear Regression is used to analyze the relationship between the size of a forest fire and other data points.

## Model Architecture
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: KNN is a simple, supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It works by finding the k-nearest data points to a given input and making predictions based on the majority vote or average of these neighbors.
- **Linear Regression**: Linear Regression is a fundamental statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It aims to fit a linear equation to the observed data.

## Dependencies
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **Python**
  - Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`
